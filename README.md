## Contributing
> Contributions are currently being accepted as Noel does not fully support different languages yet!

Contributing is as simple as forking and creating a pull request with changes or new languages you add. You can use the enUS file as an example on how to create new language files.

**%VAR%** are variables and **MUST** be added where needed when creating new languages. Languages that do not use the variables where needed will be denied.
